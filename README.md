# command-on-demand
Enable Self-Service MDM command invocation, without exposing Jamf API credentials in scripts.

**☠️ THIS TOOL CAN CAUSE IMMEDIATE AND IRREVERSIBLE DATA LOSS ☠️**
- Make sure you _fully understand_ how it works before venturing further
- Any example scripts, extension attributes and configurations are purely for convenience and to help you understand and get started with the tool
- **_Always_** use test devices when first trying this out and when testing your deployment
- Use a test/sandbox Jamf instance where possible
- See disclaimers below and in LICENSE file

## How does that work then?
`command-on-demand` is a web service which sits between your scripts and the Jamf API.

The service exposes a small API surface which your scripts call, authorised with a separate bearer token.

Various checks are carried out to determine how requests are sent to Jamf (or if they should be sent at all).

## Use cases
This tool was built with a few specific use cases in mind
- Self-Service Erase All Content & Settings (`EraseDevice` command)
- Self-Service software updates (e.g. an `InstallASAP` command with forced reboot)
- Any other commands which come in the future and make sense to make available via Self-Service

Without giving users admin or putting Jamf API creds in scripts, this isn't really possible... until now!

## Self-Service Erase All Content & Settings
Since macOS Monterey, Macs with a T2 chip or Apple Silicon CPU behave differently when getting an `EraseDevice` command from Jamf - they quickly return to factory state! 🎉

There are a few reasons to offer a Self-Service, admin-less nuke & pave:
- Your org frequently loans out devices which need to be cleared for the next user, you don't give field technicians Jamf console access but want to give them (or users) a way to reset the device between loans.
- You want to wipe your devices as part of an MDM migration 💀

Of course, this tool doesn't handle the UX that you'll likely want to present to your users, but there will be some example scripts added to this repo soon.

## Self-Service Software Updates
The `softwareupdate` command and enterprise macOS updates in general have been inconsistent or just downright broken for a number of years.
A number of really great tools have grown up around this problem in an effort to allow admins to empower users to update their machines.

There's often a technical debt associated with using these tools and Apple obviously wants us to use the MDM framework instead (whether it works or not 🙃). 

You can use this tool along with a Self Service policy and simple script to allow users to update their machines to the latest available software version.

The tool currently only supports sending the most _expeditious_ version of the command;
immediately download and install the latest available OS version, force reboot, include major versions, ask no questions, etc.
However, the plan is to add functionality allowing for setting the various options that the Jamf API allows for.
For example, only doing minor updates, or targeting a specific version.   

## Wait... This still requires putting a credential in my script!
Well, yes, but having the bearer token is only the first control, and it certainly beats using Jamf credentials. 

Note that clients can only cause a command to be sent to _themselves_ and only if they can prove established trust with the Jamf server,
and that they can modify a chosen part of _their_ Jamf device record:

1. The client requests a code, this is randomly generated by the server and is only valid for two minutes 
2. The client must then cause that code to be set in a designated extension attribute in Jamf via `jamf recon`
3. Once the recon process finishes, the client sends a second request for the command itself to be invoked, causing the service to check the value in Jamf 
4. The service then looks up the computer in Jamf and reads the value in the designated extension attribute
5. If the string in Jamf matches the one that was generated (and it's still valid), the service sends the requested command to that device via the Jamf API

By successfully modifying an extension attribute value using the `jamf` binary,
we can be sure that the device has a valid device certificate which Jamf trusts.
Since devices can only update their own device record this way, 
and taking into account the short lifespan of the code,
we can be confident that the requesting client is the one that should receive the command.

**This service absolutely should be run behind a load balancer or reverse proxy which handles TLS termination.**
This also presents the opportunity to use mTLS with client certificates as an extra protection if you need it.
Most cloud platforms offer this capability.

## Can I use this? (requirements)
- A functioning Jamf instance with:
  - A working APNS configuration
  - Sufficient access to create a Jamf admin account with the required permissions
  - Sufficient access to create/update the required extension attribute
  - Sufficient access to create/update policies and scripts
- A way of hosting this service on the public internet
- Some devices to test with which are enrolled in your Jamf instance
  - **DO NOT** use your daily driver or machines which contain important data which isn't backed up
- A working Go installation (1.20 or later)
- A full understanding of this service, what it does, and how to build & deploy it _safely_
- You know how to write (at least) basic bash/zsh or some other scripting language for the Jamf Self-Service policy scripts:
  - To perform the client-side calls to the API
  - (_Optional/Recommended_) To drive any UI you might want as a front-end to your process
    - [swiftDialog](https://github.com/bartreardon/swiftDialog) and [IBM Notifier](https://github.com/IBM/mac-ibm-notifications) are very capable tools for building an intuitive UX  
- _(Optional/Recommended)_ Working ADE/DEP setup if you care about devices being able to re-enroll successfully after an erasure

## Should I use this?
Only you can answer that. However, this project is still in its early stages and may not yet suit your environment.

Previously, I've used tools like Okta Workflows or Pipedream to achieve the same thing (and you can too!).
But sharing solutions for those platforms isn't always easy and not everyone can/wants to use them... also I wanted to learn Go and give something back to the MacAdmin & Jamf community, so that's why this exists!

**There has been limited testing done so far**; only on Apple Silicon Macs _without_ Activation Lock set.
I'll try to extend the testing to Intel and other device states (ActivationRecoveryOS/Firmware locked, etc).

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** I'm not an expert (Go) programmer; you may find bugs or see things you don't like (yes, I still need to write tests).
I cannot be held responsible for anything (bad) that happens if you use (or don't use) the code in any of the repos on my GitHub.
Use at your own risk, see LICENSE, etc. ⚠️

If you want to contribute or point out how things can be improved, **please do**!

Things I want to implement/improve:
- Allow passthrough of configurable params to Jamf API for the Software Update command
- Unit Tests
- Testing on more hardware and software configurations
- Logging, Errors and project structure can probably be done better
- The overall code quality, specifically where not idiomatic Go (or just bad Go)
- Any other (good/reasonable) ideas that surface

## I'm still here, how do I use it?
I'll write a full Wiki eventually, but here are the cliff notes...

### Configure Jamf
- Create an admin user with the following permissions and set a strong password
  - Jamf Pro Server Objects > Computers > **Create** & **Read**
  - Depending on which commands you wish to invoke, at least one of:
    - Jamf Pro Server Actions > **Send Computer Remote Wipe Command**
    - Jamf Pro Server Actions > **Send Computer Remote Command to Download and Install macOS Update**
- Create a _Computer_ Extension attribute:
  - Give it a sensible name (you'll need this later). E.g. `cmdod-code`
  - Data Type: **String**
  - Input Type: **Script**
  - See the examples below for the script content, but you're free to do what you want here.
  The only requirement is that the extension attribute reads the received code accurately - _beware of whitespace_.

### Extension Attribute Examples

#### Simple Extension Attribute
```shell
#!/bin/zsh

# Command-On-Demand Code Proof Extension Attribute

CODE_TEMP_PATH="/tmp/.cmdod.code"

if [[ -f "$CODE_TEMP_PATH" ]]; then
	CODE_VALUE=$(cat "$CODE_TEMP_PATH")
fi

echo "<result>$CODE_VALUE</result>"
```
This extension attribute simply reads out the contents of a file,
you client side script just needs to ensure it's properly written to the same path.

#### Fancier Extension Attribute requiring a counterpart device script (see below)
```shell
#!/bin/zsh

# Command-On-Demand Code Proof Extension Attribute

CODE_YIELDER_PATH="/tmp/.cmdod.code.sh"

if [[ -x "$CODE_YIELDER_PATH" ]]; then
	CODE_VALUE=$("$CODE_YIELDER_PATH")
fi

echo "<result>$CODE_VALUE</result>"
```
This extension attribute script is designed to run another script (rather than just read a file), which I've called the "yielder".
You'd place this yielder on disk as part of your client side script run.

#### Fancier, self-destructing code "yielder" script
The tiny, self-destructing script that the "fancier" extension attribute above would run.
```shell
#!/bin/zsh
echo -n "aCodeValueThatGotInjectedByAnOuterScript"
rm -f $0
```

An abridged example of this in use within an outer script, potentially being run via Self Service...
```shell
#!/bin/zsh

# Client script being run from Self Service

# ... snip ...

UDID=$(ioreg -d2 -c IOPlatformExpertDevice | awk -F\" '/IOPlatformUUID/{print $(NF-1)}')
CODE_YIELDER_PATH=/tmp/.cmdod.code.sh
CODE_VALUE=$(curl "https://cmdod.example.com/api/v1/code/$UDID" -H "Authorization: Bearer xxx")

# handle curl errors, continuing if ok

# write code yielder script to disk
cat << EOF > "$CODE_YIELDER_PATH"
#!/bin/zsh
echo -n "$CODE_VALUE"
rm -f \$0
EOF

chmod 700 "$CODE_YIELDER_PATH"

# Code will be submitted to Jamf...
jamf recon

# Check code proof and erase device
curl -X "POST" "https://cmdod.example.com/api/v1/erase/$UDID" -H "Authorization: Bearer xxx"

# ... snip ....
```
The idea with this "fancier" approach is that when the extension attribute script runs during recon, it runs the yielder,
which echos out the code _and then deletes itself_.
This is nice because on subsequent recon runs, an empty value will be returned,
and will therefore clear out the previously stored code in Jamf too.
This doesn't lend any security benefits, it's just good housekeeping. 

### Building and running the binary (if not using Docker)
- `cd` into the cloned repo directory
- run `go build -o command-on-demand cmd/main.go`
- run the app with `./command-on-demand`
  - You'll need to set environment variables; you will see errors until these are all present and correct

### Run locally for quick testing with Docker
_**Note:** The included Dockerfile is for reference only, tweak it to your preferences, or maybe don't use it at all._
- Clone this repo and `cd` into it
- Create a `.env` file and set required variable values (see below)
  - Hint: Using `openssl rand -hex 32` is useful for generating a bearer token value
- Run `docker build --no-cache -t command-on-demand .`
- Run `docker run --env-file .env --rm -p 8080:8080 command-on-demand`
  - Don't forget to update the port mapping if you changed the listen port in `.env`

### Run on DigitalOcean (App Platform)
- Be signed in to a DigitalOcean account with credits available or a payment method set up
- Click the blue button!
- Use the **Edit Plan** button to choose a plan that suits you - this should run fine on the smallest size on the **Basic** plan ($5 pcm)
  - The smallest instance type is set in the template, but DO doesn't seem to apply it at the moment 🤨
- Click **Next** and then **Edit** on the Environment Variables for the `command-on-demand-api` component
- Enter appropriate values for all require variables
  - Add and set any optional vars if you need them (see .env file example below for a full list of possible vars)
  - For any vars containing sensitive details (credentials/tokens), make sure you click the **Encrypt** checkbox
- Save and click **Next**, picking your preferred region, etc
- Click **Create Resources** and wait for the build/deploy phases to finish
- Congratulations, you've deployed the service. The public URL (ending `ondigitalocean.app`) will be displayed near the top of the page.

```

### Run in production
_If_ or how you do that is up to you.

*Whatever you do, put it behind a balancer/reverse proxy which does TLS termination - the service currently uses only HTTP for its endpoints. (Calls to Jamf are HTTPS)*

### Are there fuller client side scripts/examples?
These will appear on the wiki in the near future

## API
### Endpoints
#### GET `/api/v1/code/{udid}`
Returns a randomly generated, short-lived (2 mins) code/token. This code is associated with the `{udid}` given in the path

To help avoid having to parse/unmarshal a JSON object in shell scripts, the code is returned in the body on a single line
unless `Accept: application/json` is included in the request headers:

```json
{
  "code": "thecode"
}
```

**Anything other than a `200` response should be interpreted as an error.**

Repeated calls to this endpoint will always yield a new code for the given UDID, replacing the last (if present).

**Note**: Expired codes are pruned periodically, no cleanup is necessary on your part.

#### POST `/api/v1/erase/{udid}`
Requests that an EraseDevice command be sent to the `{udid}` given in the path.

The command will only be sent if the value of the designated extension attribute in `{udid}`'s computer record matches the one on record and hasn't expired or been pruned.

**Anything other than a `201` response should be interpreted as an error.**

**Note**: The last code for `{udid}` is "consumed" (expired & subject to pruning) when this endpoint is called, regardless of outcome.
Therefore, a new code must be requested and pushed to Jamf before calling this endpoint again.

#### POST `/api/v1/swupd/{udid}`
Requests that a software update command be sent to the `{udid}` given in the path.

Currently, this command causes the device to download and install the latest OS version available to it and forces a reboot once the preparation phase is done.

The following parameters are used in the call to the Jamf API (`api/v1/macos-managed-software-updates/send-updates`):

```json
{
  "skipVersionVerification": true,
  "applyMajorUpdate": true,
  "forceRestart": true,
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "maxDeferrals": 0,
  "updateAction": "DOWNLOAD_AND_INSTALL"
}
```

The command will only be sent if the value of the designated extension attribute in `{udid}`'s computer record matches the one on record and hasn't expired or been pruned.

**Anything other than a `201` response should be interpreted as an error.**

**Note**: The last code for `{udid}` is "consumed" (expired & subject to pruning) when this endpoint is called, regardless of outcome.
Therefore, a new code must be requested and pushed to Jamf before calling this endpoint again.

### Responses
#### Error
An error response body will contain information about the error and its origin (Command on Demand or Jamf).

Example:
```json
{
    "status": 404,
    "message": "computer not found",
    "isError": true,
    "errorOrigin": "jamf"
}
```

#### Success
Unless otherwise stated, responses for successful operations will usually conform to the same schema
as in the example above, just with `isError` set to `false` and without the `errorOrigin` key.
